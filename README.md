This is a [Boids simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids 
"Wikipedia"),
written in Python3 using Pygame2, vectorized with PyTorch.

**To use:** Run via python. (Example: `python3 vectorboids.py`)

`Esc` key to quit.

*For further details, see the [original repo](https://github.com/Nikorasu/PyNBoids).*

### Simulation Settings
There are variety of customizable settings at the top of the `vectorboids.py` file. 

These are largely split into UI settings (screen size, frames/second) and simulation parameters (number of agents, neighborhood radius).
